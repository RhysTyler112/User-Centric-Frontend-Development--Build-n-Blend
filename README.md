Build n Blend

Build n Blend is an idea for a themed coffee shop for coffee and lego builders. The idea is to bring together two hobbies that compliment each other! As we know having a good coffee machine and the price of lego is very expensive, so Build n Blend was imagined to allow enthusiasts to continue to experience what they love without having to spend a big upfront bill.
